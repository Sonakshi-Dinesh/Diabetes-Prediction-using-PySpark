ABSTRACT : 
Diabetes is one of the major diseases affected by most of the people in the world. Actually, it is a chronic disease that affects the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels. Nearly one out of six people in the world are been affected by diabetes mellitus and nearly 7 lakh people died because of Diabetes in 2020.So our aim of our project is to predict diabetes use of factors such as age , hypertension , heart disease , smoking history , HbA1c level ,blood glucose level, BMI . These factors can give a clear prediction of diabetes. The prediction of diabetes using big data frameworks involves the application of advanced data analytics techniques to large volumes of structured and unstructured data. By harnessing the power of big data, researchers and healthcare professionals aim to develop accurate models that can predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. This process typically involves gathering diverse data sets, including medical records, genetic information, lifestyle factors, and demographic data, from various sources. Through the utilization of machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis, these frameworks can identify patterns, correlations, and risk factors associated with diabetes. The integration of big data frameworks enables the identification of early warning signs and the development of personalized preventive measures and interventions. Moreover, by continuously collecting and analyzing real-time data, these frameworks have the potential to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of diabetes prediction models, ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes and better management of the disease.

OBJECTIVE : 
The objective of predicting diabetes using big data frameworks is to leverage the vast amounts of data available to accurately identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes. By employing advanced analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms on large-scale datasets, this approach aims to enhance early detection and prevention of diabetes. The primary goal is to utilize big data analytics to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors associated with diabetes, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and develop personalized intervention strategies. By integrating diverse data sources such as electronic health records, genomic information, lifestyle data, and social determinants of health, the prediction models can provide more comprehensive insights into the disease. This approach not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also facilitates the development of targeted interventions, leading to better patient outcomes, cost savings, and more efficient healthcare resource allocation. Leveraging big data frameworks allows for scalability, real-time analysis, and the integration of multiple data streams, enabling continuous monitoring and timely interventions for individuals at risk of diabetes. Ultimately, the objective is to use big data analytics to empower healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers with actionable insights to prevent, manage, and reduce the burden of diabetes at a population level.

INTRODUCTION:
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates glucose metabolism. There are three main types of diabetes:

Type 1 Diabetes: In this autoimmune condition, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. People with type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin injections for survival.

Type 2 Diabetes: This is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for the majority of cases. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy diet.

Gestational Diabetes: This type of diabetes occurs during pregnancy when hormonal changes can lead to insulin resistance. It usually resolves after childbirth, but women who develop gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
The prediction of diabetes involves the utilization of machine learning algorithms, statistical methods, and data analysis techniques. These models utilize large datasets comprising demographic information, clinical measurements, laboratory tests, and other pertinent variables to identify patterns and risk factors associated with the development of diabetes. By analyzing these patterns, algorithms can generate predictive models that estimate the probability of an individual developing diabetes within a specified time frame.
